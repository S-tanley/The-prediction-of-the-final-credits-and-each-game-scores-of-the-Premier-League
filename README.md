# Sports-Analysis-Predictions-of-the-seasonal-credits-and-every-single-game-scores-of-Premier-League

This is project for the INFSCI 0310, the topic of our project is sports analysis, and I am personly interested in football, so I just choose to analyse the Premier League.

The whole project has mainly two part, the first part is about predict the seasonal credits and the second part is to predict every single game scores.

First, we load past 10 years' data on football-data.co.uk. Then we just do some work to gather data we want from these single records. You can see raw data in the "Data" folder.

About the prediction of the seasonal credits, I just used a very simply MLR, and do some modification. You can see this part in the "Implementation of MLR for Prediction of Seasonal Credits" floder. The "Final_Data_**_**.Rmd" is the code process the data of the corresponding season. The "total_data_**_**.csv" are the csv files stores the data we processed. The "Predictions_of_the_seasonal_credits.Rmd" is the code of how we train our model and do the prediction. 

About the predict every single game scores you can see the "Implementation of Monte Carlo simulation and Poisson distribution for the Prediction of scores" folder.
